        "description": "Santa Lucia Fir (Abies bracteata) is an evergreen conifer  that grows slowly  to  70 feet. This fir is a lovely tree which grows in part-shade until established, under the fog drip of existing trees in the mountains east of the Big Sur area of California. This California native fir, also called Bristlecone Fir,  has the reputation of being the most human/garden tolerant of the firs. Santa Lucia Fir grows slowly to 3 to 4 ft in 7 years. You can use this uncommon fir where you need a small  specimen plant because it grows so slowly. The tree seems to prefer shade when young in the nursery area climate.  Weve had no cold damage to these firs at 12 degrees F  in containers. The Santa Lucia Fir  is very symmetrical and tight in structure often looking like a sheared light green Christmas tree.  In its range the rainfall is  30-70 inches/year and Santa Lucia Fir  normally grows on granite -based soils. If you live in an inland area of California with hot summers, this fir would benefit from shade and weekly sprinkling with a garden hose (wet the plant but don't wet the soil). This tree also needs mulch of shredded redwood bark or oak leaf mulch. Abies bracteata tolerates clay and serpentine.  Abies bracteata's foliage color is green, type is evergreen and has fragrance. Abies bracteata's flower color is yellow.   Communities for Abies bracteata:Mixed-evergreen Forest and Yellow Pine Forest.  ",

The White Fir is native in some areas of California that have harsh climates, (low snow load, -20 degrees F, followed by sun, and 20 mph winds. White Fir is usually a common member of the Yellow Pine Forest and grows with associated . plants such as  Parry's Manzanita (Arctostaphylos parryana), Pinemat Manzanita (Arctostaphylos  nevadensis),  ., Yellow Pine (Pinus ponderosa),  Jeffrey Pine (Pinus jeffreyi), Sierra Currant (Ribes nevadense), etc.  White Fir grows slowly,  one inch to 2 ft per year, according to how it likes you and your climate. Do not expect it to become a magnificent tree in your lifetime, but it would make a great Christmas tree in the front yard for a long time. White Fir  is called white fir because of its white bark. If you live outside of its plant community at lower elevations, this tree will grow best if you can give it a mother tree for the first 10 years of its life; that is, plant at the edge of an oak, fir, or pine (at or just outside the drip line). White Fir also grows well  in a garden setting combined with manzanitas (Arctostaphylos spp.), and Coffee Berry (Rhamnus spp.).  We have seen this tree looking good in a  landscape of boulders, with the  afore- mentioned plants, and a heavy mulch of fir bark with  brickwork pathways or redwood decking.

This species needs good drainage (no standing water after 60 minutes in a 1 foot deep hole), and is not very tolerant of  the high heat of the interior. If you are replanting them into the interior area,  give them afternoon shade and avoid organic amendments. Most of the manzanita species have been hardy to about 10 degrees F.  The manzanita also do not usually like the alkaline soil of the interior. We have had less problems with A. glauca, A. parryana, and A. pungens in this soil. In some sites these species are the only ones with which you have a chance.   Hummingbirds like these bushes for their flowers and will also nest within them. These can be very long lived, at 100 years plus. In gardens the plants have looked great after 30 years. These plants have to be mulched, to obtain the nutrients they require.

Among the toughest of the manzanitas, roots and spreads to 10' wide, usually on sandstone or clay. This would be one of the ones to try not watering in a heavily mulched garden. In southern California it is native up into the granite peaks associated with Adenostoma, Ceanothus greggii, Quercus dumosa, Cercocarpus betuloides, Cupressus forbesii and Yucca whipplei (Keeler-Wolf). In our area we have seen it on a south- facing slope mixed with Adenostoma, Ceanothus cuneatus, Quercus agrifolia, Salvia spathacea and Salvia mellifera. This species is diverse in forms and ecology. It grows primarily in the chaparral habitats discussed but it will also grow into the Yellow Pine Forest, northern California Pine Barrens and Coulter Pine Forest (Barbour & Major). Wells has had fun splitting this species and subspecies and forms. We can't fit it into the Jepson, Hoover, McMinn or Munz Keys. This form Keys fairly well into Arctostaphylos glandulosa, but it has no burl and has a Arctostaohylos glauca berry. Hoover talks about this problem in San Luis Obispo County. We previously listed this as Arctostaphylos glandulosa mollis, as when it was young it keyed to this. But then it set seed, oops, it's probably a hybrid with glauca, but shows more of the glandulosa in the form, leaf, stem and trunk. Arctostaphylos glauca-glandulosa tolerates clay.

The red trunks and gray foliage are dramatic. This manzanita, like most manzanitas, tolerates summer water the first year only, then one summer watering will usually kill it. In coastal areas it will do fine as long as you do not water past the 3rd year during the summer-fall period. In the area of the foothills of the central Sierra Nevada this is one of the common chaparral components. The gray foliage and red bark make a showy planting amongst boulders with a mulch layer. It is excellent combined with oaks or pines. Associated plants range from  ,  , ,  , to with . Mariposa manzanita is an amazing insect plant. When it is in flower all sorts of weird bees, flies and butterflies show up and party. No they do not seek you out to bite you. They are only interested in the large pink flowers and only see you as a large threat, like we would see a bull or bear. Which is how we seem to act. Arctostaphylos viscida is very similar to A. mariposa. Ironically, A. mariposa is the more hairy and glandular. A. viscida is generally the less drought tolerant than A. mariposa and generally occurs at 3000-5000 ft.

It is very drought tolerant even occruing in some high desert areas.  It is found mostly in Southern California. It can sometimes be found with  Salvia apiana, Eriogonum fasciculatum polifolium, Quercus engelmannii, Diplacus sp., Mirabilis sp, and Artemisia californica.  The alkaloids associated with this milkweed and other milkweeds give the butterflies that feed on it protection from predators. Alkaloids from the wrong milkweed (South American, Mexican, etc.)  can expose the butterflies to predation. If the monarch or other butterfly has not evolved with the milkweed they may have limited tolerance for the particular alkaloid or latex  of the plant species. The California flyway runs from Baja to Canada, it does not include Mexico proper nor Central America. If you live in Chicago you can plant Mexican species (Asclepias mexicana) or Asclepias tuberosa, don't plant our species. You might look at the Monarch entry in James Scott's Butterflies of North America and articles by Fink, L and L.P. Brower. Asclepias californica tolerates sand and clay.

Native from Oregon to Baja in the coast ranges and Sierra Nevada mountains. Likes full sun and fast drainage. Use as an open screen (8') or as a small tree. It can have heavy scent when in flower (Plum blossoms mixed with roses).  This plant is very, very drought tolerant. It was planted in a job in Taft (Shadscale Scrub), watered once, and left in full sun, for 3 summer months and 3 of 10 survived (Saltbush (Atriplex lentiformis) died on the site)! This Ceanothus is also deer proof, and cold tolerant to at least 0 degrees F. It is usually growing with oaks, pines and Adenostoma fasciculatum. I've seen this species in a variety of soils. Ceanothus is a secondary pioneer plant after fires. The best germination I've seen after a fire was on a site down the road from us in heavy clay that was turned into fired brick after the 1985 Las Pilitas Fire. The stumps were not even left as bumps, the rocks on the surface were cracked, and there was no ash. The seedlings were every 1/2\" covering a 20-30' area. We have heard that when fire occurs, all the seeds are burnt up, and that is one of the reasons why the agencies in California promote seeding (alien grasses) after fires but Ceanothus cuneatus did not receive that news bulletin! Tough plants! Native on the nursery site. A good understory plant to grow in the shade of Ceanothus cuneatus, with mulch of Ceanothus leaves and twigs, is Viola pedunculata. Good companion plants for Ceanothus cuneatus are Pinus sabiniana and Quercus douglasii.  Ceanothus cuneatus tolerates sand, clay and serpentine.  Ceanothus cuneatus's foliage color is green and type is evergreen. Ceanothus cuneatus's flower color is blue and has a fragrance.

Likes full sun, some summer water for faster growth, regular water in desert areas. It's tolerant of clay soils, and  needs a winter chill before flowers set properly. Flowers and young pods are edible. The young, small redbud plants are not cold hardy below 20 degrees F. Older plants are no problem at 10 degrees F. or less. Tolerant of lime or acid soils, pH 5.5-8 is safe. In our climate Western Redbud flowers about the same time as Ceanothus, and brings in people from the road who want to know what it is. The flowers usually emerge before the leaves. Its reddish-purple seed pods hang on the tree in winter. We used to never have problems with scale; now with Argentine ants there can be a problem. If you get scale, treat with Safer soap, and deal with the ants. Also, the Eastern Redbud, Cercis canadensis has more problems in a California garden than the Western Redbud. They can be very unhappy, homesick and usually just sick. The only real problems we've had with Western Redbud, is the need for four seasons. If you plant a Redbud next to the ocean, they may not do dormant, or they may not come out of dormancy. If your garden has never seen frost, Western Redbud may not be for you. If you live in Montana and experience winter temperatures below 0F, Western Redbud is not for you. If you have a typical 20X50 foot front yard in Lodi, Redbud may be the perfect small tree for you.

        "description": "Curl leaf mountain mahogany is an evergreen shrub or small tree to 15 feet tall, that grows in desert mountains of the  western U.S. Excellent as a  tough screen or accent plant, and an attractive plant for dry situations, due to its structure and evergreen nature.  I like this plant because of its white bark and dark green leaves, and I believe it is much under utilized. Use as a bonsai  in front entrance planters, or as a specimen dwarf tree. These have been easy for us to grow, cold hardy, drought tolerant, and garden tolerant. I really can't say any thing bad about this plant other than it doesn't have showy flowers. It's neat, tidy, pretty clean (you get seed litter that blows away but hardly any  leaf litter) and interesting. The white bark combined with the dark green leaves with white undersides make an unusual impact. We saw these in the June Lake area at 7000 feet growing with Ceanothus velutinus var. velutinus, Purshia tridentata, Artemisia tridentata,  Penstemon bridgesii, and a Castilleja sp. It was 6-8' tall and growing in full sun on an east- facing slope in granite. We also saw it on the Kennedy Meadow Road growing as a 15 foot tree, and from a distance it looked like a funny oak tree.

Sulphur flower buckwheat thrives in dry, hot exposed spots. This flat perennial ranges west of the Rocky Mountains, likes part shade to sun, and little or no water after established.   Sulphur Buckwheat needs good drainage to the point of living in gravel. An excellent low groundcover for small areas that are too poor to support most plant life. It's very drought tolerant but best with a little water after establishment (regular water the first summer). All varieties are tolerant to cold. Most are native to 4000 ft, plus,  elevations. Our original planting is 20 years old and still looks good, with good flower shows each year.  In pine forest,  in open, sunny area between trees, plants occurring nearby are  Artemisia tridentata, and Pinus ponderosa.  Eriogonum umbellatum tolerates sand.  Eriogonum umbellatum's foliage turns a different color in the fall, color is silver and type is evergreen. Eriogonum umbellatum's flower color is yellow.

This flannel bush is smaller and a littler more garden tolerant than most of the other forms. In our garden it is 8 feet by 8 feet; this is a lot smaller than even the species.  This form is growing like a weed and flowers from May through August; never a heavy flower set,  just continual,  3 inch flowers.   Flannel bushes like lighter soils with moisture nearby, but not near the crown.  Their favorite spots are sandy washes with moisture down 8 ft or so below grade level.

In areas where the snow is on the ground until March to June this plant will flower all summer. I've seen it in the snow fields and in dry rocky sunny sites at 6000-8000'. In San Diego it is at about 3000 ft on a rocky south facing slope mixed with Diplacus Clevlandii and Brodiaea. It has done well within sight of the ocean and ok in the desert as long as it gets watering. This is another plant that doesn't behave as you would think. It survived up in our garden with no water for two seasons in full sun, flowering its little heart out each morning from late March until mid-July. The reason it did not get water is the drought (11\" one year and 5\" the next) did not allow us to use any. In the garden it does need to be trimmed down each winter.

Penstemon heterophyllus X  'Margarita BOP' is a nice tidy perennial that looks like candy tuft or a dwarf boxwood when not in flower,  and a  mass of bright sky blue to reddish purple flowers when in bloom. (The soil, sunlight and watering all can change the flower color.) Sometimes the color will vary year to year, sometimes plant to plant, usually  tints of purple in a mass of  clear deep water blue. Penstemon 'Margarita BOP' was a  seedling that came up sometime in the early 1980's. It is a hybrid between Penstemon heterophyllus and Penstemon laetus . Every year it would flower and be gorgeous, clear sky blue, fading to purple, at the bottom of our front porch.  We've never watered it nor maintained it. Every year we talked about how beautiful, neat, clean it was. The bicycles, skateboards and dogs had run over it tens of times but it still looked good at the Bottom Of the Porch. (This plant will 'key' to P. heterophyllus but we believe it is a second generation hybrid with P. laetus . Seeds are fertile and will come back Penstemon heterophyllus . Many of the Penstemons in the Transverse ranges have  forms similar to this, good luck figuring out which species they are!) The original plants died in 1998(after 14-18 years, (we're not sure), when a tree fell on it. The arborist parked his rig on the plant, cut  and put the wood on the plant,  the wood was moved and a  cement mixer was then parked on the plant and cement spilled on the plant fixing the retaining wall the tree broke. I figured out the plant was in trouble when I realized the dirt where the plant was supposed to be was 2 inches of cement. (You have to realize this was a very big tree.) So, I guess that finally killed it. I guess this Penstemon is not quite as tough as I thought, it cant live under two inches of cement for three months.

Native to the coast ranges and the Sierra Nevada mountains to British Columbia, Montana and Utah. Ninebark likes part shade in hot locations along with garden water. It becomes a drought tolerant plant for the sunny areas at higher elevations or coastal areas. Its bark is distinctive, showing several layers, and interesting texture. The leaves remind one of small grape or currant leaves and turn intense red to orange in the fall. The spring flower show is delightful. The shape of the plant looked like a bouquet when it was in flower. Grows in riparian areas of many plant communities, such as chaparral mixed evergreen forest, and yellow pine forest. In the Sierra Nevada mountains the plant grows more upright, and in the central coast ranges the stems are more spreading and arching. The form we sell is from the central coast ranges and its hardiness is such that we lost most of the gallon size potted plants in the 1990 freeze (-4 degrees F.)  Ninebark grows on average 5 ft. high by 5 ft. wide, needs no irrigation water at all in central and northern coastal areas of California. This plant will also tolerate a lot of water when it's dormant (even standing).  Ninebark will grow under sycamores (Platanus racemosa) and cottonwoods (Populus trichocarpa) and tolerates serpentine soil. Physocarpus capitatus tolerates sand, clay and seasonal flooding.

        "description": "Quercus lobata is a deciduous white oak tree that can grow to 70'. The fastest of our California Oaks. This native oak  has deeply-lobed leaves with no bristles. The coloration is green with a little grey. It is native to the central valley, valleys of Sierra foothills, and coast ranges of California. Valley oak likes sun and moderate water. These oaks  are found in some of the valleys of California ,when the water table was lowered below 70 feet or so, these trees died. (This picture was of one of the last oaks in Riverdale, where there used to be hundreds, if not thousands of huge trees set in a pastoral setting.)  They like to be plugged into a water source if possible,(thus the name Swamp oak) but not waterlogged. The water source  need not be huge, but it does need to be there. One of our friends put his well next to the biggest one on his property thinking he would strike an artesian well, the well only gave 1 gallon/minute in the winter. All summer it was dry...we need more than the tree does.  Deer eat this one when they are hungry. (Aren't they always?) This one is also native on the nursery site in Santa Margarita. Easy to grow,  it will grow up into a whip for the first years. Before the canopy starts developing, at first into a vase, then an umbrella.. Valley Oak is a fast tree, with water it can grow to 20' in 5 years, 20 more in the next 5. It will then slow down in height, then begin to fill into a vase-like tree. It may stay in this form growing slowly taller for 100 years. After 20 years your tree should look like a 40-60' elm tree without the elm diseases. A bunch of birds will be hanging around it using the acorns and the limb structure for nests. If you come to the nursery the tree at the gate is a valley oak. The old trees you see in many of central and northern  California  valleys may be 300-500 years old, or 50, often very hard to tell. They have a tendency to be all the same age as they need a high water table for 5-7 years to establish. We have some that are 1' tall that established during the floods of 1979-1981. They were burnt in the 1979 fire and the 1985 fire but they survived the 83-90 drought. 200 years from now they will be the 70'.  Other Valley oaks were not there in a 1957 picture and are now 80 feet tall with moss growing on them, we figured they were 100-200 years old until we saw the picture. There are others in a different picture of the same filed that look the same now as then and are the same size as the young whipper snappers. Valley oaks are probably the most tolerant of weeds or lawn under them. If you plant a young one in a lawn area they will flourish. Do not plant a lawn under an old one though, the tree needs to grow with the lawn, Lawn under old tree, kills old tree, headline reads.   Quercus lobata tolerates sand, clay and seasonal flooding. Quercus lobata is great for a bird garden. Quercus lobata's foliage color is green-gray and type is deciduous. Quercus lobata's flower color is na.

Oaks do not like fertilizer. 4a. You can use some trace nutrients in some situations.(Unless the trees were just planted the chlorosis is probably horticultural. I.E., because of a lawn  tree, weeds or septic system under the tree.) 4b. Chorosis also occurs because  someone cut a ditch near, (within 2X the root system,) the tree. 5.

It is not specific to one soil, growing in sandy loam, granitic scree, and red loamy clay. In the garden if it is happy it makes a very large flower spike (5') with 100+ 1\" flowers. White sage is hardy to about 15 F. here in the central coast ranges, but is more hardy in the desert areas.  In its range it receives between 6-26\" of rain/year. This is one of the sages used in sweat lodges in the past and apartments in the present. Most of the stuff sold in the upscale trendy places was ripped out of the wild; whole hillsides stuffed into an old van and driven to San Francisco or Seattle or even  New York so people can experience something.  Well,  the hillsides of southern California do not need the experience;  go burn  old socks or something to experience what the hillsides are experiencing. If you do buy one of these burn sticks, may your soul go with the smoke. Curse on you. (Especially the lady that called up protesting the curse.) We sell gallon plants we grow from nursery-grown plants. Plant a few white sage for your own sticks and a few for your friends. If you only have a small yard look at the , the leaves are about the same size but the plants are smaller. If you're in the Midwest look at as that was the smudge plant of that area. This plant has lead to some interesting questions: \"Would you define the Salvia apiana leaf 'fragrance/scent' for me? We are trying to develop a Salvia apiana scented votive... Our response, kinda  like sage/pine needles/burning rubber/skunk. Burn that in your pipe! Salvia apiana tolerates sand and clay. Salvia apiana is great for a bird garden.

Common Snowberry is native to the coast ranges, San Luis Obispo north to Alaska and has edible, white berries. (Before you get all excited, they taste like bitter Ivory soap. The Thrashers will eat them when everything else is eaten, but they have a silly gagged look as they choke the berries down. Dazed and confused fits in with everything else around here, though.) The berries rot on the bushes in good years, in bad they do not even get a chance to ripen. Snowberry likes sun to shade, some summer water. Hummingbirds visit this in summer when the small, pinkish flowers are on it. In the fall, on wet years, or if regularly watered, Snowberry is very beautiful as the bush becomes overloaded and the branches start to arch from the weight of all the white berries developing at the tips of the branches This is a nice, underused plant. If you live in an area of snow it is an effective large scale groundcover. Its root system is vigorous and deep enough to hold most banks. Snowberry is stream-side in many locales and would be an excellent restoration plant. This plant is native down the road from us where there is a little more moisture. There, the rainfall range seems to be 25\" per year and up. Grows with Rosa californica, and Cornus glabrata here. Soils do not seem to matter as long as the drainage is fair. This vigorous species can take the interior conditions a whole lot better than Symphoricarpos mollis , Creeping Snowberry, but Creeping Snowberry is a better choice in very coastal areas with shade.

        "description": "(see S. albus laevigatus, http://www.laspilitas.com/plants/667.htm) A 2-4ft deciduous shrub, gradually forming a small thicket 4-6ft wide. Native to the coast ranges, San Luis Obispo north to Alaska. It has edible, (only if you are dying!) white berries. It likes sun to shade, some summer water. Hummingbirds work this in summer when the small pinkish flowers are on it. We sell a large amount of this in the fall because of the white berries. It will not set berries in the milder areas of the state. This is a nice underused plant. If you live in an area of snow it is an effective large scale groundcover. Its root system is vigorous and deep enough to hold most banks. It is streamside in many locales and would be an excellent restoration plant. Thrashers and towees will eat the berries when they get hungry enough to eat them. (They are very bitter.) (The berries rot on the bushes in good years, in bad they do not even get a chance to ripen.) This plant is native down the road from us where there is a little more moisture. There, the rainfall range seems to be 25inch and up. Soils do not seem to matter as long as they can drain a little. This species can take the interior conditions a whole lot better than S.mollis. We currently do not grow this plant.  Symphoricarpos rivularis is great for a bird garden. Symphoricarpos rivularis's foliage type is deciduous. Symphoricarpos rivularis's flower color is pink. Symphoricarpos rivularis's fruit is edible.  Communities for Symphoricarpos rivularis:Chaparral, Mixed-evergreen Forest, Riparian (rivers & creeks), Yellow Pine Forest and Central Oak Woodland.  ",

It was growing in association with Stanley pinnata, Prunus fasciculata, Ribes quercetorum and Lycium cooperi in one spot, and under Quercus Wizlizenii mixed with Solidago canadensis elongata in another.  It was in full sun growing out of rocks in the hotter spot, cool roadside in the other.  Mountain California fuchsia  is growing fine in the nursery here, and although the flower show is much better at higher elevations , it's not bad here most years, gorgeous on good years. We planted this fuchsia in several locations, and when we finally got it right it is a flowering machine!  Driving all the hummingbirds crazy with sprays of red fuchsia flowers.  I would try it at Julian, Big bear, Arrowhead, Sequoia maybe even Tahoe. In the right location it is HOT red on green foliage.

It usually grows best under Jeffery Pine, Ponderosa Pine, or White Fir. It can grow up to just below the tree line. It usually grows next to seeps or snow banks. It looks beautiful at higher elevations and burnt at our location until we found a spot it likes.  It has been fairly stable here, looking good in spring, the top missing after a few weeks of 110 degree temperatures.  If your climate gets down to -10F or -15F with no snow cover or -30F with snow cover and summer temperatures that stay below 85 degrees this is a great plant! Use it in rock gardens or perennial gardens. This would be an excellent plant to try in The Pacific Northwest, The Northeast and Europe.
